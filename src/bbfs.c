  FUSE.  It was my first FUSE filesystem as I got to know the
  software; hopefully, the comments in this code will help people who
  follow later to get a gentler introduction.

  This might be called a no-op filesystem:  it doesn't impose
  filesystem semantics on top of any other existing structure.  It
  simply reports the requests that come in, and passes them to an
  underlying filesystem.  The information is saved in a logfile named
  bbfs.log, in the directory from which you run bbfs.
